##### cat, head, tail, wc, which #####
cat     #displays and joins files
head -n     #display the first n lines of the file
tail -n     #display the last n lines
     -n +2  #skip the first 2 lines and display the rest till end
wc file.txt     #count of lines, words, and bytes in file.txt
which     #show location of executable file


##### GREP #####

grep -l	"GAATTC" 'filename(s)'     #list only the filenames that contain GAATTC, not entire lines
grep -i     #ignore letter case
grep -v "Toolik Lake"     #return lines that don't match "Toolik Lake"
cat *.seq | grep ">"     #returns lines that contain ">" from all files that end with .seq
cat *.seq | grep -l "GAATTC" > file.txt     #writes filenames that contain GAATTC from all files that end with .seq to file.txt

-c show the number of lines that contain the pattern, not the number of times the pattern matches. If the lines have multiple patterns, -c will underestimate
     #EG: count the number of sequences in a FASTA file using grep -c ">" 
	 #EG: number of lines in a file grep -c $, where $ denotes line endings
-v invert search and show only lines that do not match
-i match without regard to case
-E use regex syntax with the exception of wildcards; use [] to indicate character ranges and enclose search terms in quotes
-l list only the filename containing matches
-n show the line numbers of the match
-h hide filenames in the output



##### CURL #####
curl "url" > file.txt     #download contents of url into file.txt; same as curl "url" -o file.txt
# save all reports from day [01-30] in one text file:

curl "http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/MIA/1992/08/[01-30]/DailyHistory.html?&format=1" >> miamiweather.txt 

# save each month's report in its own numbered file using the extension #1 in the file output
curl "http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/MIA/1979/[01-12]/01/DailyHistory.html?&format=1" -o Miami_1979_#1.txt


##### SED #####
s     #substitute
p     #prints the line
d     #deletes the line

sed 's/xxx/zzz/' file.txt or sed 's:xxx:zzz:'  #replaces xxx with zzz in file.txt
sed -E     #use extended regular expressions
sed 's/xxx/&/'   #replaces the pattern with the matched pattern
## EG: sed 's/xxx/(&)/' will return (xxx)
## EG: replace [rana raniceps] with rana_raniceps
sed -E 's:\[([a-z]+) ([a-z]+)\]:\1_\2:' file.txt
